# simple-form-builder

## What is this?

This is just a simple form builder (front-end only) inspired by [Microsoft Forms](https://forms.office.com/). I made this for technical test on a company, so this intended just test of my skills. I made this with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
